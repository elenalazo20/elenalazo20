# Hi — I'm Elena Lazo 👋

**Epidemiology PhD student @ PUC Chile**  
*New to GitHub and learning in public.* Still shaping my thesis idea, with interests in **environmental pollution** and **implementation science (CFIR/EPIS)**.

### Currently learning
- Quarto (reproducible reports & sites)
- Git & GitHub (version control, issues, PRs)
- QGIS for maps (basic spatial workflows)

## About (third person)
Elena Lazo is a PhD student in Epidemiology who is currently refining the focus of her dissertation. She is just getting started on GitHub and intentionally documenting her learning. Her work bridges **air-pollution and public-health policy evaluation** with **implementation science** (CFIR/EPIS, Proctor outcomes). She builds **reproducible research** with **R** and **Quarto** using **Git/GitHub**.

- 🔭 Current interests: PM2.5 health impacts, program evaluation of clean-air initiatives, implementation outcomes & equity.  
- 🧪 Methods: time-series/ITS basics, mixed-methods (interviews + admin data).  
- 🛠️ Tools: **R**, **Quarto**, **Git/GitHub**, **QGIS** (maps).
